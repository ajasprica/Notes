To validate Module 1 and correctly answer the questions will require that you perform the following exercise first: take the code in the file named module1.R, and modify it such that (1) the segmentation variable "frequency" is replaced by its log (before it is scaled), and (2) you select a 5-segment solution instead of a 9-segment solution.

You'll be asked to answer these questions :

What is the size of the largest segment?

Of the five following criteria to determine the best number of segments, which one is the least relevant?

Looking at the average profile of segment 1, would you say that members of this segment are typically...(you'll have to choose the right proposition)
